3,Recruit Function,"Not-so-long in a galaxy not-too-far away, I once created a recruit script that eased the process of creating a recruit mod for TSL only. It always felt a little unjust that TSL modders should get that burden eased while KotOR I modders still had to suffer through the old (and semi-lengthy) way of coding a recruit script. I think this should both further ease the process of TSL recruitment mods & finally relieve the process for KotOR I recruitment mods somewhat.",2012-05-28 00:00:00,354
